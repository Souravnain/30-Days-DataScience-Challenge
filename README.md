# 📊 30 Days of Data Science Challenge

Welcome to my personal 30-day challenge to sharpen my Data Science skills by building one project every day — from beginner to advanced level!

## ✅ Day 1: Google Trends Analyzer

A Python project that uses the **Google Trends API** to analyze real-time search trends for any keyword.  
Visualizes search popularity over time and exports data to CSV.
